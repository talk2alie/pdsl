                        Exploration for oil and gas, in Sierra Leone,
                        started in the mid 1980's, with two wildcat
                        exploration wells drilled by Mobil [Mobil Al]
                        and Amoco [Amoco A1-2] in 1984 and 1985,
                        respectively.

                The Republic of Sierra Leone is strategically placed on the African continental shelf, signaling
                excellent potential for the exploration of oil and gas in the country. With recent discoveries along the
                Equatorial Atlantic Margin, these are exciting times for the Petroleum Directorate of Sierra Leone in
                our mission to opening our shores to deepwater exploration.
            </p>
            <p class="lead mt-2">
                Sierra Leone is moving with great resolve and determination on the road of development and prosperity under 
                the Medium-Term National Development Plan (MTNDP). In line with the MTNDP, the oil and gas sector will play 
                an essential role in transforming Sierra Leone, driving the country’s economic development and growth.
            </p>
            <p class="lead mt-2">
                At its core, the Petroleum Directorate is mandated to lead the process of unlocking and realizing the country’s 
                petroleum resource potential, as well as transforming its growth agenda through the sustainable development of 
                the oil and gas sector- a position we constantly strive to maintain. Our principal duty is to regulate the 
                exploration and production of affordable, reliable, and cleaner energy in Sierra Leone.
            </p>
            <p class="lead mt-2">
                To achieve this mandate, our vision is to transform the country’s oil and gas sector in a responsible manner 
                that prioritizes safety, respect for communities and the environment. In our mission, we will conduct business 
                with honesty, integrity, and transparency. We place great importance on implementing judicious governance and 
                compliance practices.

                internal processes and acquiring technically skilled professionals. With a focus on pursuing the right partnerships 
                and opportunities, as well as utilizing robust fiscal stewardship practices, we have successfully navigated and 
                adapted through challenging times within the global oil and gas industry.
            </p>
            <p class="lead mt-2">
                With an enthusiastic outlook for the future, we will continue to build a top-tier team with all the industry 
                requisites, pursue innovative ways to maximize the value of our resources, form mutually beneficial partnerships, 
                and drive in-country value to ensure that Sierra Leone harnesses its full oil and gas potential.
            </p>
            <p class="lead mt-2">
                The Petroleum Directorate is tenaciously committed for Sierra Leone to become a leading producer of oil and gas 
                operating with a high level of performance in the exploration, development, production, and distribution of oil 
                and gas-related services.
